# Spirit Files

Spirit File to use with Spirit Desktop Mascot

# Unbuilt Spirit Files

Some spirit files may contain copyright audio but these cannot be stored in a Github
repository which may result in a DCMA takedown. So those type of Spirit files will not
be built or released in this repository. Instead those can be built locally by you, you
need to execute ```hooks.sh``` shell script under linux (do something similar in your
platform) and make the spirit directory using **ritual** as usual.

But I will be providing those types of Spirit files from some other source so only link
will be taken down in case of copyright notice.
